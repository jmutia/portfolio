          <h3>I guess it's more about of what I do.</h3>
          <p>Well, I have been in the information technology field for more than 10 years, most of which are mainly focused on IT services. From just being your regular techguy to a more customer oriented IT professional.</p> <p>Fast-forward to today, my passion for web and graphic design is still unquestionable. With this portfolio, it simply reflects how my right brain perfectly coordinates with my left brain activities.</p>
          <p>All in all, despite the vagueness of how technology interacts with the way we live, the constant need for learning is what drives me to move forward and further embrace information technology.</p> <p>It just makes me feel so fortunate, to be part of it.</p>
